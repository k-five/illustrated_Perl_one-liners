Hello everyone :)

This is my idea to put Perl one-liners in more attractive style.
I am not a hacker and of course not even a programmer and JUST
I am new typist in **C++** and **Perl**

Also I am beginner in `writing` in English and may be you find
some mistakes here or on the pictures I apologize about that.

I hope this style of Perl one-liner would be fun for you

**License**
Before I create this repository I get allowed from Petter ...
who have written a book about Perl one-liners and I have read
that book and 99% of the one-liners take from this book.


#Waht tools have I used?
1. konsoke ( terminal of KDE )
2. takes a picture form the window with `Alt + Print` key
   - or using command line: `gnome-screenshot -w -f` that have used it in **spacing** 

3. using figlet ( or toilet ) to make special text-font on the screen
4. using lolcat to colorize the output of figlet
5. using `convert` to make **gif** file form **png** file
   - with: `convert -loop 0 -delay 500 *.png output.gif`

6. using **ffmpeg** to convert **png** file to **mp4** file ( through STDIN )
   - with `cat *.png | ffmpeg  -c:v png -f image2pipe -r 0.5 -i - -y test.mp4`

7. using **ffmpeg** to add audio file to *mp4* which I created
   - with: `ffmpeg -i video -i audio -c:v -codec -shortest output.


#WARNING
The two below handy-code are JUST for fun and show how to use one-liners in use.
Of course everything that you dump, STILL, belongs to the two dictionary.
