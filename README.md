This is my idea to put Perl one-liners in more attractive style. So that you can see the output of each one-liners and understand it convenience.  
I am a new typist in **C++** and **Perl**, may be you see some mistakes.  
Also I am beginner in `writing` English and may be you will find  
some mistakes here or on the pictures, so _I apologize about that._  

I hope this style of Perl one-liner would be fun and useful for you.

**License**

I got allowed from [Peteris Krumins](https://github.com/pkrumins)

that book and 99% of the one-liners come from this book. But
a few of them not in the book, like: **generate full password**  
or ...
